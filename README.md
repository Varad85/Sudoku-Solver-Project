# Sudoku-Solver-Project
This project is a Python implementation of a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm. The Board class encapsulates the Sudoku board and provides methods for displaying the board, finding empty cells, and checking the validity of moves. The solver method uses backtracking to find a solution to the puzzle.

Features

Sudoku Board Representation: 

The board is represented as a 2D list, where empty cells are denoted by 0.

Visual Representation:

The board can be printed with grid lines for easy visualization.

Backtracking Algorithm:

The solver uses backtracking to fill the board.

Validity Checks:

Methods to check if a number can be placed in a specific row, column, or 3x3 square.
